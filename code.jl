dissect the following request into a Request object:

what is the newest file that i have?

dissect my command into an action and an input upon which this action will be applied.
you should write a function representing that action.

"it" should in general refer to the memory kept in the variable "ans".
# is this needed?

your entire output will only consist of code.

you will write exactly one function, which will have a typed signature.

the name of the function should be as descriptive in human language as needed.
